    <h1> Overview of the Emissions Data </h1> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The data used in this web app is sourced from the CORGIS Dataset Project, all of which can be found here.
        The data contains information on the carbon emissions from all countries all around the globe. The carbon
        emission data ranges from years 1970-2012. The information records the amount of carbon dioxide, nitrous
        oxide, as well as methane that were released from the power industry, infrastructure of building, transportation,
        other industries, and other sectors. These are all measured in equivalent kilotons of 
        CO2.
        <br>
        The data rationalizes the emissions in per capita and per GDP. Carbon emissions per capita are measured as the 
        total amount of carbon dioxide that is emitted by the country as a result of relevant human activities, 
        divided by the population of the country. Per GDP signifies, per capita gross domestic products, which is 
        the measurement of a country's economic output per person. (source) </p>
